## Welcome to the repo.  
First and foremost the OOP Edition of Cryptex is meant to give more structure to the program we are all passionate about.  
We made it easier to impliment new ciphers into cryptex by offering up a `template.py` file within `/src/cipher/cipher` which is made to be easy to work with to get new ciphers hooked into the cryptex main body.
## As of this point...  
We are working on bringing OOP Edition up to Earth Invader level before pushing is into the main organization repo.
