## History
Cryptex started out in November 2021 with one developer Alex "Cythes" Kollar as an attempt to be less of a script kiddy.  
It has since became so much more. In April of 2022 the official 'Cryptex Development Team' formed. Consisting of members of two security groups with one common goal. To make cryptex the 'metasploit' of cryptography. Since then A few great dev's have come and gone from the project but Cryptex persisists. If you want to know more about the previous developers go check out [Credits](https://github.com/SSGorg/Cryptex/blob/main/credits.md). Cryptex has evolved so much in just the little time it has existed. Going from a hodge podge of tools and scripts to being a fully functional professional grade tool. In this release the core dev team has taken a step back and completely refractored the tool to work with Object Oriented Programming. As well as making it easier to impliment new Ciphers and tools into the program it self.
